         The Capewell-Dvorak Keyboard Layout
==========================================================================

The Capewell-Dvorak keyboard layout is a layout based on the Dvorak
layout developed by Drs. August Dvorak and William Dealey in the 1920s 
and 1930s.  Changes were made by Michael Capewell to make it more 
comfortable to type with.

How to install and use the Capewell-Dvorak keyboard layout (Windows XP):
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Steps could be different with other versions of Windows.

1. Installing the Layout
   ---------------------

       Here, we are simply installing the file containing the layout 
       definition.

   a)  Right-click on the installer file (e.g. "Capew023.msi") 
       and click 'install.'  
       The keyboard layout will be installed right away.  
   b)  Click 'close' on the window that pops up when it's done installing.

2. Setting up Windows to Use the Layout
   ------------------------------------

       Here, we are telling Windows that this is a keyboard layout we 
       would like to use.  After this step, you will not yet be using the
       Capewell-Dvorak layout.  Windows will still be set up to use the 
       layout you are currently using.

       If you are not using Windows XP, please see 
       http://www.mwbrooks.com/dvorak/dos.html


   a)  Open the Control Panel
   b)  Open 'Regional and Language Options'
   c)  Click the 'Languages' tab
   d)  Click the 'Details...' button to open the 'Text Services and Input
       Languages' window.
   e)  Click 'Add...'
   f)  In the 'keyboard layout/IME' dropdown box, 
       select 'Capewell-Dvorak (0.23)' and click 'OK'
   g)  Click 'OK' to close the 'Text Services and Input Languages' window.
       A little keyboard icon should show up on your task bar*.
   h)  Click 'OK' to close the 'Regional and Language Options' window.

   *   If not there is no little keyboard icon on the taskbar after
       completing all the steps in part 2, please consult Windows Help & 
       Support for how to display the 'Language Bar.'


3. Switching to the Capewell-Dvorak Layout
   ---------------------------------------

       Now, we switch to using the Capewell-Dvorak layout!

   a)  There should be a little keyboard icon on your taskbar, near the
       clock.  If not, please consult Windows Help & Support for how to 
       display the 'Language Bar.'
   b)  Click the keyboard icon.  In the small window that pops up from 
       the icon, select 'Capewell-Dvorak (0.23)'.
       This will only set the currently active window to use the Capewell-
       Dvorak layout.  This is a bit confusing at times, but you may want
       to do this to use the new layout in one window for practice while
       keeping your old language as the default for other programs, such
       as instant messaging, while you are learning Capewell-Dvorak.
   c)  If you wish to completely switch to Capewell-Dvorak, then 
       i)   right-click the keyboard icon
       ii)  select 'Settings...'
       iii) in the 'Default input language' area at the top of the window,
            select the Capewell-Dvorak language from the drop-down box.
       iv)  If you wish, you can also remove your old keyboard layout by
            selecting it in the 'Installed services' list and clicking
            'Remove.'  (The keyboard icon will disappear)
       v)   Click 'OK' to close the window


    There!  You are now set up to use the Capewell-Dvorak keyboard layout!

    But wait!  There's a Step 4!

4.  Reboot
----------

    Reboot to make the keyboard layout behave properly and consistently.
    (Windows! Bah!)

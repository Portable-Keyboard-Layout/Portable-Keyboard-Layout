; The original mode for non-ASCII characters may not work with

; nonASCII.ini, and please send me too!

; Windows internally translates the AltGr (right Alt) key to LEFT Ctrl + RIGHT Alt
; If you enable this option, PKL detect AltGr as (one of) Ctrl + (one of) Alt.

; It is not recommend, because fortunately some programs know the
; difference between the AltGr and the Alt+Ctrl

; If you often forget to exit PKL at a shared computer, you can set a 
; suspend timeout in minutes: after this time of inactivity (with no 
; keypresses) PKL will suspend. The exit timeout is similar: after
; this time is spent suspended PKL will exit.
; For example if you use suspend=5, exit=30, then after 5 minutes of 
; inactivity PKL go suspend – if you are there, you can go live. If you 
; forgot disable PKL, within 5 minutes your friend can cry to you.
; After 30 minutes in suspend PKL exit.
; You can disable these features by setting the timeouts to 0.
; Important: only "coming out from suspend" is activity for exitTimeOut, 
; so if you write 0 to suspend and 30 to exit, it will exit after 30 
; minutes, even you type or pressing keys.
